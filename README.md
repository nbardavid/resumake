## How it works

- Extracts text from job postings using [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability).  
- Uses a private [Mistral](https://mistral.ai) agent to adapt your resume to the job description.  
- Converts the result into LaTeX and compiles it into a downloadable PDF.  
- Runs as a self-hosted Next.js app with Docker and Traefik.

## Notes

- This project depends on **private Mistral agents**.  
- Even with a Mistral API key, it cannot be run locally.  
- Please use the hosted version: [resumake.nbardavid.dev](https://resumake.nbardavid.dev).
